# Method: MCA

Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) is an extension of Correspondence Analysis(CA). It helps to analyze the pattern of relationship among several nominal variables. It is used to analyze a set of observations described by a set of nominal variables. Each nominal variable is comprised of several levels and each of these levels is coded as a binary variable.

MCA can also accommodate quantitative variables by recoding them as “bins.”

# Dataset : oasis_cross-sectional

The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) is a project aimed at making MRI data sets of the brain freely available to the scientific community.
It is a cross-sectional MRI Data in Young, Middle Aged, Nondemented and Demented Older Adults.
This set consists of a cross-sectional collection of 216 subjects (rows) aged 33 to 96. The subjects include both men and women. 
It measures 216 subjects (rows) on 4 quanitiative variables (columns). The 5 qualitative variables have been used to interpret the data. 

Measures included in the study:

Age: Age (years)

Gender: Male or Female

Education: Years of Education - Recoded into categories from 1 (highest) to 5 (lowest)

SES: Socioeconomic status classified into categories from 1 (highest) to 5 (lowest)

MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination score – range from 0 (worst) to 30 (best)

CDR: Clinical Dementia Rating - (0 = no dementia, 0.5 = very mild AD, 1 = mild AD, 2 = moderate AD)

ASF : Atlas scaling factor (unitless). Computed scaling factor that transforms native-space brain and skull to the atlas target (i.e. the determinant of the transform matrix)

eTIV: Estimated total intracranial volume (cm3)

nWBV: Normalized whole brain volume, expressed as a percent of all voxels in the atlas-masked image that are labeled as gray or white matter by the automated tissue segmentation process
